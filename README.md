- 👋 Hi, I’m @petaflot [aka @engrenage or @engrenage1 (twitter)]
- 👀 I’m interested in fundamental physics, field theory (thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, ...), number theory, and quite a few other things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to enjoy life
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a next-generation indexing and storage paradigm (I've been working on it since 2007 or so, it works but needs quite a bit of coding to make it more user-friendly)
- 📫 How to reach me : https://www.engrenage.ch/i18n/association/contact/
